The tutorial includes nodes and parameters, however the examples here use both nodes and parameters without a specific example.

* Nodes:
    Each example is a node. Ex: service.py is a servicer node; client.py is a client node.

* Parameters:
    These examples are very simple/generalized and thus don't contain very many parameters. However, here is one I found in the publisher example: timer_period = 0.5  # seconds. "timer_period" is a parameter of the publisher node has which tells it the frequency of which to publish messages.
